# Employee Attrition analysis and prediction

This project focuses on analyzing employee data to identify the main factors influencing attrition and predicting employees at risk of leaving. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning models, it helps organizations develop targeted retention strategies, reduce turnover costs, and improve workforce stability.

## Features

#### Data Exploration & Cleaning : 
Handle missing values, outliers, and data imbalances.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Visualize trends in attrition by age, job role etc..
#### Machine Learning Models :
Train classifiers (Random Forest) to predict attrition risk.
#### Model Evaluation :
Assess accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for reliable performance.
#### Interactive Dashboard :
Provide visual insights and predictions for HR teams using tools like Streamlit.
#### Predictive Analytics: 
Input employee details to predict stay/leave probability.
